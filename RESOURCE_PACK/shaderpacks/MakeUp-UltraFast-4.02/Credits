Some of the code is inspired by the ideas presented below:

------

- Enhanced ambient occlusion is based on Capt Tatsu's ambient occlusion used in
BSL Shaders:
  https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders/

- Interleaved noise from:
"NEXT GENERATION POST PROCESSING IN CALL OF DUTY: ADVANCED WARFARE"
http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2014/index.html

- Integer Hash by iq from:
https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4tXyWN

- TAA is based on Erkaman's TAA simple implementation:
  https://gist.github.com/Erkaman

- Phi noise by TinyTexel
 https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wltSDn
 Based on:
 http://extremelearning.com.au/unreasonable-effectiveness-of-quasirandom-sequences/

If any functions were listed here, and are no longer listed,
they have been removed or replaced by own functions.

I am not a graphics developer, I made this shader out of curiosity and
my personal use, but I think it is good enough to be shared.

I have not copied (not exactly), but have tried to learn, adapt and modify
other people's ideas in favor of the shader.
